# BayesAnalysis

This project built a generalized latent spatial factor model to model death and treatment rates for 88 counties in Ohio to assist the policy
makers decision making in the allocation of medical resources across the state. We utilized Nimble framework in R with Monte Carlos sampling methods, created map visualizations to examine treatment and death
rates across the country and selected the best model by evaluating on R squared metrics and credible interval (P-value equivalent)
